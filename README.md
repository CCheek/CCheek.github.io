## Welcome to my site on the interdimentional spider webs

This site was built to mostly be a dump for files that need to be fixed and/or I have nowhere else to put and/or I just want on the internet.

Have fun, and I accept most changes that have no deletions. Have a great time exploring!

Main Body code (when included) comes from a project I worked on for [Zevo](https://Zevo.io "Zevo Homepage").

Style sheet comes from [CSS Zen Garden] and [Dan Mall]
